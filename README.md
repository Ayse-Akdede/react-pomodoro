## Pomodoro Clock

Like everyone else in this Jepsen class, I watched the youtube video [Build A Pomodoro Clock In React ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EVmiQCfkuQ) by Nsquared Coding.

## How to run my pomodoro

You can clone my repository.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:Ayse-Akdede/react-pomodoro.git
```

Then go into the directory.

```
$ cd react-pomodoro
```

When you're in the directory do the following code.

```
$ npm start
```

And finally open the link that shows in the terminal.

```
$ Server running at http://localhost:1234 //localhost:SOMETHING
```

## Notes

My pomodoro insn't fully done, but the countdown is working :)
